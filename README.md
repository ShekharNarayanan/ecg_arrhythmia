# ECG Data Exploration & Preprocessing

This project focuses on **exploring/analyzing ECG data** with literature-backed methods with the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (PhysioNet)**. There is also focus on making these scripts more production ready in terms of how other teams can use the data science pipelines developed. 

Current work includes:
- Loading and inspecting raw ECG signals and annotation labels
- Visualizing beats across different channels (e.g. MLII, V5)
- Examining class distributions and preparing the data for potential machine learning experiments
