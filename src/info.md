# LABELS/ BEAT INFO

# MIT-BIH Beat Annotations (Subset in Your Data)

- **N** — Normal beat  
  Normal sinus rhythm beat. Majority class.

- **V** — Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC)  
  Beat originating in the ventricles. Typically wide QRS complex. Clinically significant if frequent.

- **A** — Atrial Premature Beat (APB / PAC)  
  Early beat originating in the atria. Often subtler than PVCs.

- **+** — Rhythm change marker  
  Not a beat type. Indicates a rhythm annotation event.  
  Should be excluded from beat classification.

- **L** — Left bundle branch block beat (LBBB)  
  Ventricular conduction delay in the left bundle branch. Wide QRS with characteristic morphology.

- **R** — Right bundle branch block beat (RBBB)  
  Ventricular conduction delay in the right bundle branch. Also wide QRS, different pattern than LBBB.

- **e** — Atrial escape beat  
  Late beat originating in the atria when the sinus node fails to fire.

- **j** — Nodal (junctional) escape beat  
  Late beat originating from the AV junction due to sinus node pause.

- **a** — Aberrated atrial premature beat  
  Atrial premature beat conducted abnormally through the ventricles (often wider QRS).

- **J** — Nodal (junctional) premature beat  
  Early beat originating from the AV junction.

- **S** — Supraventricular premature beat  
  Premature beat of supraventricular origin (group category, not more specific).

- **E** — Ventricular escape beat  
  Late ventricular beat occurring when higher pacemakers fail.

- **F** — Fusion of ventricular and normal beat  
  Hybrid beat formed by simultaneous activation from ventricular and normal conduction pathways.

- **/** — Paced beat  
  Beat generated by an artificial pacemaker.

- **f** — Fusion of paced and normal beat  
  Hybrid between pacemaker-driven beat and intrinsic beat.

- **Q** — Unclassifiable beat  
  Beat that could not be reliably categorized.
